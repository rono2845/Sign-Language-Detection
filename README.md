# Sign-Language-Detection

# Motivation

The 2011 Indian census cites roughly 1.3 million people with “hearing impairment”. In contrast to that numbers from India’s 
National Association of the Deaf estimates that 18 million people –roughly 1 percent of the Indian population are deaf. 
These statistics formed the motivation for our project. As this speech impairment and deaf people need a proper channel to 
communicate with normal people there is a need for a system. Not all normal people can understand the sign language of
impaired people.

# Background: 
  Our project is to determine sign language. Basically, the project aims to achieve better communication using sign languages.

# Objectives:
  ● Prepare image data for training
  ● Create and compile a simple model for image classification
  ● Train an image classification model and observe the results
  ● Prep data specifically for a CNN
  ● Create a more sophisticated CNN model, understanding a greater variety
  of model layers
  ● Train a CNN model and observe its performance
# Final Result:
  The training accuracy is very high, and the validation accuracy has improved as
  well.
